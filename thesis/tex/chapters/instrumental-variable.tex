\chapter{Application in Econometrics: Instrumental Variable Regression}

In this chapter, we turn our attention back to the main application being considered in this thesis: instrumental variable  regression.
We start by formally characterizing the type of problem this econometric approach was developed to solve, and then present one of the most well-known and employed\unsure{Is it?} estimation procedures for conducting it: two stages least squares (2SLS).
Nextly, we show how an IV regression problem can be formulated as a linear inverse problem and discuss the seminal nonparametric method of Newey and Powell \cite{newey2003}, followed by a more recent nonparametric approach called Kernel Instrumental Variable (KIV) \cite{singh2019}.
We finish with an in-depth analysis of our method, pointing out its relationship to other methods, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.
