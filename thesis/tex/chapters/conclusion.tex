\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this thesis, we have presented an overview of instrumental variable regression, dived into more details about some relevant approaches which have been made to the nonparametric version and explained our own attempt to tackle this problem.

In our future work, we aim at providing more robust benchmarks of SAGD-IV against other popular algorithms, as well as with more challenging data generating processes.
We also wish to test its performance in cases where the response is binary, i.e., when we have $ Y = \ind \left\{ \hstar ( X ) + \varepsilon > 0 \right\} $, since our theoretical results are applicable in this situation.
