\chapter{Nonparametric Instrumental Variable \\Regression and Linear Inverse Problems}

Having defined what we mean by nonparametric regression instrumental variable (NPIV) regression, we now present two well established approaches, one of which will serve as a starting point for our method.
We first describe the idea behind Newey's seminal paper on NPIV \cite{newey2003}, which develops a nonparametric analog of 2SLS, and them move on to the more inverse problem (IP) oriented approach presented in \cite{florens2007}
\improvement{Take a look at the article by Florens, Darolles and Renault on Econometrica in 2011 as well}
