## What I want to include

* Inverse problems
* Instrumental variables
* Kernel methods
    * RKHS theory, representer theorem, Mercer's theorem
    Maybe some theory of random elements on hilbert spaces

## Structure


* Introduction
    * Talk about inverse problems in general, integral equations,
      ill-posedness, examples, maybe cite the NeurIPS paper.
    * Talk about Kernel methods and their applicability
    * Focus a bit more on Instrumental Variable Regression

* Inverse problems
    * Define inverse problems in general
    * Integral equations
    * Regularization methods
    * ???

* Kernel Methods
    * Explain the ideia behind kernels in general, but make it clear we
      are focusing on kernel ridge regression
    * Define RKHS and explain a bit of the theory
    * Vector RKHS
    * Random elements in Hilbert Spaces?

* Application in econometrics: Instrumental Variable Regression
    * Basic 2SLS
    * Newey paper
    * KIV
    * Our method
